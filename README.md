# TI-Programs
A bunch of programs I wrote back in the day for my TI84CE calculator. I don't remember what they all do. Some programs call other programs and pass data by setting variables.

## Clock
Is a cool little clock.

## Draw
Lets you draw on the screen with the arrow keys. The enter button enables and disables the pen.

## Expon
Simple exponent solver. Would probably be easier to type in what you are trying to solve manually.

## Factors
Gives you the numbers that can factor into another number.

## Funktown
Bunch of functions. It is supposed to display the functions on the screen.

## GCD
Supposed to find the greatest common denominator.

## Geoseqen
I don\'t recall, but it looks complete. Integration?

## Hyprbola
Solves a hyperbola.

## Key
Waits for you to press a key, then tells you what the key number is.

## LCM
Least common multiple of any number of terms you input.

## Magovec
Solves the magnitude of the vector.

## Midpt
Solves the midpoint of the vectors.

## Pascals
Outputs the selected row of Pascal's triangle.

## Prefix
Displays the prefix names and their exponential form.

## Refangle
Gives you the reference angle based on what you input.

## Std2vtx
Converts standard form to vertex form.

## Trigraph
Outputs useful trig stuff.

## Untcir
Draws the unit circle. Make sure you are in radians.
